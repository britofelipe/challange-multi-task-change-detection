1. Feature Engineering
Strengths:

Geometric Features: Calculates polygon properties like area, perimeter, aspect_ratio, and circularity, which align with the paper’s emphasis on small object detection.

Temporal Decomposition: Extracts day/month/year from dates, which helps capture seasonal patterns.

One-Hot Encoding: Handles multi-valued categorical features (urban_type, geography_type) correctly.

Weaknesses:

Missing Temporal Dynamics: Ignores time intervals between dates (a key insight from the paper).

Example: days_between_date1_and_date2 could model progression of construction.

No Neighborhood Features: The paper highlights the importance of urban/geographic context (e.g., "near a river"), but these are only one-hot encoded, not spatially modeled.

Limited Spectral Features: Only uses mean/standard deviation of RGB bands for two dates (date1, date2). The paper used multi-date imagery for robustness.

2. Preprocessing
Strengths:

CRS Consistency: Projects data to EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) for geometric accuracy.

Missing Value Handling: Uses median imputation and replaces NaNs/infs, critical for stable model training.

Weaknesses:

Log-Transform Optionality: Applies log-transform to geometric features but doesn’t validate if it improves distributions (e.g., skewness).

No Spatial Scaling: Centroid coordinates (centroid_x, centroid_y) are not normalized, which could bias models like PCA/GBM.

3. Feature Selection
Strengths:

SelectKBest: Uses ANOVA F-value to prioritize features, reducing noise.

Weaknesses:

Arbitrary k=14: No validation for why 14 features are optimal.

Incompatible with GBM: Tree-based models (e.g., GBM) inherently handle feature importance; manual selection may discard useful features.

4. Model Architecture
Strengths:

Gradient Boosting: Suitable for imbalanced data (common in QFabric) and handles non-linear relationships.

Weaknesses:

No Class Weighting: Doesn’t address class imbalance (e.g., rare "Mega Projects") via class_weight='balanced'.

Shallow Depth (max_depth=4): May underfit complex spatial-temporal patterns.

No Cross-Validation: Trains on the entire dataset, risking overfitting (no validation set metrics).

5. Evaluation
Strengths:

F1-Score Focus: Matches the Kaggle evaluation metric (mean F1).

Weaknesses:

Train-Set Evaluation Only: Reports metrics on training data, which are overly optimistic.

No Test-Set Predictions: Assumes Kaggle’s test labels are unavailable but doesn’t validate on a holdout set.

6. Alignment with QFabric Paper Insights
✅ Geometric Features: Matches the paper’s focus on polygon properties.

❌ Temporal Modeling: Lacks multi-date analysis (e.g., LSTM/ConvGRU layers).

❌ Spatial Context: Misses neighborhood metadata interactions (e.g., "industrial area + river proximity").

❌ Class Imbalance: No oversampling or weighted loss for rare classes.

Critical Issues
Feature Selection Redundancy:

Tree-based models (GBM) don’t require manual feature selection. SelectKBest may discard discriminative features.

Temporal Features Underutilized:

Ignores sequential status transitions (e.g., "Land Cleared → Construction Midway").

Data Leakage Risk:

StandardScaler is fit on the entire training data, not per fold in cross-validation.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Fixed n_estimators=60, learning_rate=0.03 without grid search or Bayesian optimization.

Recommendations
Enhance Temporal Features:

Calculate time intervals between dates.

Encode status sequences (e.g., status_date0, status_date1).

Address Class Imbalance:

Use class_weight='balanced' or SMOTE.

Replace accuracy_score with balanced_accuracy_score.

Optimize Model Architecture:

Increase max_depth (e.g., 6–8) and tune via cross-validation.

Replace manual feature selection with GBM’s built-in importance.

Incorporate Spatial Context:

Add interaction terms (e.g., urban_type * geography_type).

Use spatial embeddings for coordinates.

Validation Strategy:

Split training data into train/validation sets.

Use stratified K-fold cross-validation.

Leverage Pretrained Models:

Experiment with architectures from the paper (e.g., MultiDate-XdXdUNet).
